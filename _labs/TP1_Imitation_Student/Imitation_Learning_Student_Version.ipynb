        "Imitation Learning (IL) is a set of techniques aimed at training a model to directly mimic an expert's actions from a collection of demonstrations. In this practical, we focus on **offline imitation learning**, meaning we assume there exists a dataset consisting of demonstration data in which each sample correspond to a state-action pair collected from the expert. In practice, this might mean collecting keystrokes of a human player on an Atari game, controls of a human-driven car, or medical decisions of a doctor along a course of treatment. In this case, the goal of an IL algorithm is to learn a policy (i.e., a full mapping from states to actions) that mimics the expert policy (for which you only have a set of observations)."

        "#### Observational Results\n",
        "\n",
        "- Success rate: ~40% (0.40 average reward out of max 1.0)\n",
        "- Average steps: ~60 when successful, high variance indicates inconsistent performance\n",

        "#### Theoretical Expectations\n",
        "\n",
        "From a theoretical perspective, these results align perfectly with the known limitations of behavioral cloning. The partial success rate reflects the fundamental challenge of distribution shift. The model performs well on states similar to those in the expert demonstrations but struggles when encountering novel situations. The high variance in performance demonstrates the cascading error problem inherent to behavioral cloning, where small deviations from the expert's trajectory compound over time, leading to failure. This outcome was expected since behavioral cloning lacks mechanisms for error recovery or exploration, making it inherently brittle compared to reinforcement learning methods that learn through trial and error.\n",

        "___\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion on the practical\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout our work, we've seen the complete pipeline from environment design to policy evaluation. We began by implementing a grid world environment with proper MDP dynamics, then generated expert demonstrations using systematic policies like right-down and left-up strategies. The behavioral cloning model successfully learned to imitate these demonstrations, achieving partial but meaningful performance. This mirrors the classic trade-off in imitation learning: while behavioral cloning is straightforward to implement and can quickly learn reasonable policies from demonstration data, it fundamentally lacks the robustness and generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning methods. The results demonstrate that behavioral cloning serves as a valuable baseline approach, capable of capturing expert behavior patterns but limited by its dependence on demonstration quality and inability to recover from errors, precisely the theoretical limitations we expected to observe in practice."

        "- Both environments showed similar average step counts (81.75 vs 90.10 steps)\n",
        "- The stochastic environment demonstrated a 20% success rate compared to 10% for deterministic\n",
        "- Higher standard deviations in both metrics indicate inconsistent performance across episodes\n",

        "The observed results present an interesting case where the stochastic environment outperformed the deterministic one in terms of success rate, which contrasts with typical behavioral cloning theory. Normally, stochastic transitions exacerbate the distribution shift problem in behavioral cloning, as the learned policy encounters states not represented in the expert demonstrations. However, in this specific instance, the stochasticity may have provided a form of \"exploration boost\" that helped the agent overcome local optima or navigate around obstacles more effectively than the deterministic policy. This aligns with the concept that some level of randomness can sometimes aid in navigation tasks by providing alternative paths to the goal. \n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, the high variance in both environments confirms the fundamental limitation of behavioral cloning: without mechanisms for error recovery or online adaptation, the performance remains unstable and heavily dependent on the quality and coverage of the demonstration data.\n",
